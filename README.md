# OngwaeGPT Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables by creating a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. You will need to add your MongoDB connection string:

```
MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
